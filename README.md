# ⚙️ Architecture Overview

Kurunegala Furnitures is implemented using a **Hybrid Next.js Web App / Electron Application Architecture**. 
The system follows a **Modular, Component-Based layered pattern**:
1. **Presentation Layer:** 
2. **State Layer:** 
3. **Data Access & API Layer:** 
4. **Desktop Containerization Layer:** 
5. **Logic Layer:** 

### Frontend (Storefront & Admin Views)
- **Next.js 16 (App Router)** - Server-side rendering and routing
- **React Three Fiber / Drei** - WebGL 3D rendering pipeline
- **Tailwind CSS & Framer Motion** - Utility styling and animation micro-interactions
- **Zustand** - Global state management for 3D configurators

### Backend
- **Next.js API Routes** - Dedicated serverless endpoints (`/api/products`)
- **JSON Data Layer (Mocking future MSSQL)** - Real-time file system CRUD via `fs/promises`
- **Node.js**
- **MSSQL** - Future database integration

### Desktop App Container
- **Electron.js** - Wraps the Next.js local server for dedicated admin desktop usage
- **Concurrently & Wait-on** - Start sequence orchestration

### Local Persistence
- **Local File System / `data.json`** - Handled server-side to prevent client tampering

# 🧠 Engineering Lessons

During development of Kurunegala Furnitures the focus areas included:

- **WebGL Optimization Context:** Managing complex GLTF/GLB models dynamically inside React components without tanking FPS. Heavily utilized `useMemo` for materials and scene objects.
- **Unified Codebase (Web & Desktop):** Architecting the app so standard web consumers and Electron desktop admins share the same Next.js core, decoupled by route segments.
- **Complex UI/UX Synchrony:** Ensuring Zustand state perfectly matches `framer-motion` layout animations and WebGL material updates simultaneously.
- **Windows MAX_PATH Limits:** Learning how modern bundlers interact with OS-level path restrictions, resulting in a fallback Webpack strategy for deep bundle structures.

# 🔧 Key Design Decisions

1. **Next.js App Router API over External Node Server**
   Kept the architecture monolithic for the MVP. The Next.js API folders inherently act as a secure proxy to the data layer, reducing infrastructure overhead and latency to zero.

2. **Electron for Admin Terminal**
   Instead of exposing the global inventory system on the public internet, wrapping the Next.js output in Electron provides a secure, "kiosk-like" desktop terminal for shop owners.

3. **Zustand Over Context API**
   Given the high frame rate requirements of the 3D canvas, Zustand was chosen to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the `useConfigurator` state updates material values.

4. **JSON File System as Initial DB**
   Opted to construct a robust abstraction layer `lib/db.ts` utilizing `data.json` so the entire frontend could be verified immediately. (MSSQL integration planned on the Roadmap).

5. **Modular, Layered Folder Architecture**
   Strict separation of Presentation, State, Logic, and Data.

If you need any further information or clarifications, go to the [Design Decisions](docs/design_decisions.md).

# 🗺️ Roadmap

Key upcoming features planned for Kurunegala Furnitures:

- ✅ **DONE** — Core 3D engine integration and GLB loaders
- ✅ **DONE** — Other elements and theme integrations
- 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** — MSSQL Database integration replacing local JSON
- ⏳ **NOT STARTED** — Stripe Payment Gateway Checkout
- ⏳ **NOT STARTED** — Admin Order Fulfilment Workflows

---

# 🚀 Future Improvements

Planned enhancements include:

- Role Based Access Control (RBAC) securely locked inside the Electron IPC bridge.
- Web and Desktop App synchronization - This will allow you to make changes in the web app and see them in the desktop app.
- Webhooks for order fulfilment - This will allow you to get notified when an order is placed.
